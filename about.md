Hi, my name is Vasiliy Kevroletin and I am software developer from
[Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok).

My working experience is documented in the [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYpssQXmZXHBpub5bl1paPN1dPfiYkFY/view?usp=sharing).

Throughout my career I have been working on
* stabilizing and optimizing c++ code for an embedded system
* implementing libraries and services in c++ and java
* managing self sufficient small team which was in charge of development,
  support and deployment of services for internal use.

Aside from code development I also worked on documentation: I documented
produced code and gathered requirements for new library. I also developed tests
by my own initiative to improve one very unstable system.

I am passioned about technologies especially about software development. I
often spend my free time learning about interesting stuff like
functional programming, programming languages or libraries.
