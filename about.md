Hi, my name is Vasiliy Kevroletin and I am software developer from
[Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok).

My work experience is documented in the
[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffs4oQuzhzgH1Lt-NHzgdSKwe_Tec1jj/view?usp=sharing).

Throughout my career, I have been working on

* [current] Blockchain projects using functional programming languages (Haskell, OCaml)
* embedded projects using C++
  + stabilizing and optimizing C++ code for an embedded system
  + implementing libraries and services in C++ (with Lua) and Java (with Groovy)
* CI system using Java/Groovy
  + developing a CI system for embedded projects
  + managing a self-sufficient small team which was in charge of development,
    support, and deployment of services for internal use.

I want to write reliable software. Because of that aside from code development I
often work on documentation and tests. Nowadays I learn functional programming
and one day I'll learn some advanced type-level wizardry.

I am passionate about technologies, especially software development. I often
spend my free time learning about interesting stuff like functional programming,
programming languages or libraries.

Feel free to contact me. In addition to email, you also can easily reach me
