### Me

Hi, my name is Vasiliy Kevroletin and I am software developer from
[Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok).

My work experience is documented in the
[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xQOlXfzTq1xcLtBBYEpBIwzjV7QhOdpb/view?usp=sharing).

Throughout my career, I have been working on

* stabilizing and optimizing C++ code for an embedded system
* implementing libraries and services in C++ (with Lua) and Java (with Groovy)
* developing CI system for embedded projects
* managing a self-sufficient small team which was in charge of development,
  support, and deployment of services for internal use.

Aside from code development I also worked on documentation and tests. I
documented my code and gathered requirements for a new library. I also developed
tests on my own initiative to improve one very unstable system.

I am passionate about technologies, especially about software development. I
often spend my free time learning about interesting stuff like functional
programming, programming languages or libraries.

Feel free to contact me. In addition to email, you also can easily reach me in
the telegram, my nick is
[kevroletin](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@kevroletin).
