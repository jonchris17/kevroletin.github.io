Hi, my name is Vasiliy Kevroletin and I am a software developer from [Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok).

Here is my CV to a position of [Haskell developer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1crZT4AC5l23rtxN32xqbtVLDk3a85Xvh/view?usp=sharing).

Past two years I haven't been employed. I've spend time relaxing from work, traveling (which was tricky during pandemic), improving my health and taking care of my family. I am grateful for taking such opportunity and I've learned many important lessons during that time.

Throughout my career, I have been working on

* **blockchain** projects using functional programming languages (**Haskell**, OCaml);
* **embedded** projects using **C++**
  + stabilizing and optimizing C++ code for an embedded system
  + implementing libraries and services in C++ (with Lua) and Java (with Groovy)
* **CI* system using *Java/Groovy**
  + developing a CI system for embedded projects
  + managing a self-sufficient small team which was in charge of development, support, and deployment of services for internal use.

In additional to coding, I had experience **managing a team**. 

When it makes sense, I care about correctness, efficiency and complexity of software. Because of that, aside from code development, I often work on **documentation and tests**. Nowadays, I practice functional programming and I've learned some basics of formal verification. In recent years, I've shifted my perspective from thinking mostly about tools to thinking more about **people**; nowadays I think that right relationships between colleagues is as important as having right technical skills.

Feel free to contact me. Besides email, you also can easily reach me:
